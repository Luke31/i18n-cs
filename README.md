# i18n-cs
This is a collection of Visual Studio 2015 Applications to demonstrate internationalization in C# Code, WinForms, WPF and WIX installers.
The default language is English and translations to Japanese are added. This approach is recommended so systems other than Japanese or English will see an English interface.

For the specific documentation see the [Github Wiki of this project](https://github.com/Luke31/i18n-cs/wiki)
